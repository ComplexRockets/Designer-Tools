- [**Change Log** ](https://github.com/ComplexRockets/Droon-ComLinks/releases) 

-------------------

Some functionalities will be spread around the designer interface but you will find most of them under the designer tools tab on the left. Currently, the only tools added are the Reference Images tools and some view tools, when you open the panel you will be able to switch to an orthographic view and add reference images to simplify and have a greater precision for building replicas. 

-------------------

**Note that this mod won't make your craft unsharable. Even if MODS DON'T WORK ON MOBILE any craft you build with this mod will still be useable on mobiles or computers that don't have the mod installed as these are just tools and nothing gets uploaded with the craft.**

-------------------

**Bug reports and suggestions:**
I'll gladly take any bug report or suggestion here in the comments or over on discord on SRC or Complex Rockets. Just make sure to check the [RoadMap / Bug list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A08BAIZfXJTmighpOlyPSuBFjNgyf2iADexnp39mKQw/edit?usp=sharing) before to see what features are already planned and what bugs are already known.
